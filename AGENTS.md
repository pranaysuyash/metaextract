# AGENTS.md (Repo Root)

This repo’s agent instructions live in:

- `doc/AGENTS.md` (development guide + conventions)
- `doc/AUDIT_REMEDIATION_WORKFLOWS.md` (canonical workflow/prompt text: Audit/Implementation/PR Review/Verification/Hardening/Triage/etc.)
- `doc/UI_REVIEW_WORKFLOWS.md` (canonical UI review/audit/spec prompts)

If instructions conflict, prefer the most specific file for the directory you are working in, then prefer `doc/AUDIT_REMEDIATION_WORKFLOWS.md` when running one of its named workflows.

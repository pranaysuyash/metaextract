# MetaExtract Launch Readiness Checklist (2026)

To move from "comprehensive but unlaunched" to a successful market entry, the following critical milestones must be met.

## 1. Technical "Last Mile" Core (7-9 Weeks)
- [ ] **Deep Bitstream Forensics**: Implement direct NAL unit/OBU parsing for H.264, HEVC, and AV1 to reach the 150k field milestone.
- [ ] **Advanced Doc Forensics**: Integrate content-level macro and object stream analysis for PDF/Office formats.
- [ ] **Professional Standards Integration**: Full SMPTE/EBU metadata registry compliance for broadcast-grade verification.

## 2. Competitive "Moat" Features
- [ ] **C2PA (Content Credentials) Integration**: Full support for hardware-signed provenance to combat deepfakes.
- [ ] **AI-Generation Detection Engine**: Integrated heuristics to detect GAN/Diffusion artifacts in metadata and bitstream.
- [ ] **Persona Engine V4**: Refine the 131k field interpretation for the "Forensic Mike" persona to ensure elite-level reports.

## 3. UI/UX Transformation
- [ ] **The "Expert View"**: A D3-powered dashboard to visualize 131k fields without overwhelming the user.
- [ ] **Mobile Optimization**: PWA implementation for on-site field investigations (Sarah persona).
- [ ] **Batch Processing UI**: Stabilize the multi-file upload zone for 2GB+ files.

## 4. API & Monetization
- [ ] **Expert API Documentation**: Finalize the OpenAPI spec for the 131k field engine.
- [ ] **Tiered Quota System**: Implement DodoPayments for the "Pro" and "Enterprise" (Scientific/Forensic) tiers.
- [ ] **Rate Limiting & Abuse Resistance**: Stress test the backend for concurrent 131k field extractions.

## 5. Launch Strategy
- [ ] **Public Beta (Soft Launch)**: Targeted at 100 invited forensic and professional media users.
- [ ] **Open Source "Community Edition"**: Finalize the core engine license (AGPLv3) and documentation.
- [ ] **Technical Whitepaper**: Publish the "131k: Why Field Depth Matters in 2026" report to establish authority.

# Images MVP - Minimal Python Dependencies
#
# Goal: support `server/routes/images-mvp.ts` extraction path while keeping
# the deploy footprint small (avoid heavy scientific/ML stacks used elsewhere).
#
# Notes:
# - Full IPTC/XMP is extracted via the `exiftool` system binary (installed via Nixpacks/Docker),
#   so we do not depend on Python XMP/IPTC libraries here.
# - The core engine is designed to degrade gracefully when optional libs are missing.

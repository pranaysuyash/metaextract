# MetaExtract - Session Notes

## Jan 3, 2026 – V2 Findings & LLM Enhancements

### What changed

- Added `/api/metadata/findings` (LLM-powered) with graceful fallback when `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is absent.
- Results persistence: extraction response now saves to storage and returns an `id`; `/api/extract/results/:id` serves saved results.
- V2 KeyFindings: LLM-first extraction with automatic fallback to rule-based findings, loading/empty states, friendlier device names, improved authenticity checks.

### How to use

- Set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in `.env` to enable AI answers; without it, rule-based findings still work.
- V2 page loads metadata via navigation → sessionStorage → DB by `?id=` (shareable links supported).

### Notes

- Logging is dev-only for KeyFindings.
- Reverse geocoding is still TODO (shows coordinates for now; LLM may describe region when enabled).

## Dev helper: Running Pyright with repo venv 🔧

We added `scripts/run-python-tool.sh` and `scripts/run-pyright.sh` to detect and activate the repository venv (checks `VIRTUAL_ENV`, `.venv`, `venv`, `env`, and supports `poetry`) before running Python tooling. Usage:

- Run `./scripts/run-pyright.sh` to run `npx -y pyright` under the detected venv.
- Or run `./scripts/run-python-tool.sh <command...>` to run other commands under the repo venv.
- To override, set `RUN_VENV=/path/to/venv ./scripts/run-pyright.sh`.

Example:

```
./scripts/run-pyright.sh --version
./scripts/run-pyright.sh
```
